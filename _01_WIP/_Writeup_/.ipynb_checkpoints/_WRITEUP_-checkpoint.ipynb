    "**Abstract â€”** this notebook is the writeup of the Behavioral Cloning project as part of the SELF-DRIVING CAR nanodegree program. We apply Deep Learning to clone the behavior of a human driver by getting training data from examples of human driving in a simulator. Then these data feed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map features from camera images directly to steering commands. This way the CNN learns to predict the appropriate steering angle when the car drives in autonomous mode in the simulator.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this project are broken down into the following steps:   \n",
    "* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior\n",
    "* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images\n",
    "* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set\n",
    "* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road\n",
    "* Summarize the results with a written report\n",

    "**Note:** the architecture has been inspired by the [nvidia neural network](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf) before being tweaked a bit using the [Keras](https://keras.io/) deep learning library with Tensorflow backend. The convolutional neural network has been trained only with the sample data provided by Udacity."
